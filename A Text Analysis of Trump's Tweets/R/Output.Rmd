## R Markdown

When Trump wished the Olympic team good luck, he was tweeting from an iPhone. When he insulted a rival, he was usually tweeting from an Android. Is this an artifact showing which tweets are Trump’s own and which are by some handler in the 2016 campaign?

Others have [explored Trump’s timeline](https://www.cnet.com/news/trumps-tweets-android-for-nasty-iphone-for-nice/) and noticed this tends to hold up. And Trump himself [did indeed tweet from a Samsung Galaxy](https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/5/9453935/donald-trump-twitter-strategy) until [March 2017](https://www.vox.com/2017/5/27/15705090/president-donald-trump-twitter-android-iphone-ios-samsung-galaxy-security-hacking). But how could we examine it quantitatively? During the development of the tidytext R package, I was writing about writing about text mining and sentiment analysis, and this is an excellent opportunity to apply it again.

Let's load the content of Donald Trump’s timeline. Our dataset is from [The Trump Twitter Archive](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/) by Brendan Brown, which contains all 35,000+ tweets from the [@realDonaldTrump](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/) Twitter account from 2009 (the year Trump sent his [first tweet](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-first-tweet-2017-5?r=DE&IR=T)) through 2018. We'll filter it for the election period only, June 1, 2015 through November 8, 2016.

```{r part_1}
# Load the libraries
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
library(lubridate)

# Read in the data
tweets <- read_csv("~/Desktop/GitHub Repositories/RPubs/A Text Analysis of Trump's Tweets/datasets/trump_tweets.csv", guess_max = 36000) %>%
  filter(created_at >= "2015-06-01", created_at <= "2016-11-08" )

# Inspect the first six rows
head(tweets)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
