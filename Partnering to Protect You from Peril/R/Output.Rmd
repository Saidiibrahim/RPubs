## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

# load the libraries
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(igraph)
library(ggraph)
library(RCurl)

# Import the edgelist from the naccho2016clean.csv file
edges <- getURL("https://github.com/Saidiibrahim/RPubs/blob/main/Partnering%20to%20Protect%20You%20from%20Peril/datasets/naccho2016clean.csv")

health_dep_edges <- read_csv(file = edges)

# Import the attributes from the naccho2016att.csv file
nodes <- getURL("https://github.com/Saidiibrahim/RPubs/blob/main/Partnering%20to%20Protect%20You%20from%20Peril/datasets/naccho2016att.csv")

health_dep_nodes <- read_csv(file = nodes)

# Merge the edgelist and attributes into a network object
health_dep_net <- graph_from_data_frame(d = health_dep_edges, 
                       vertices = health_dep_nodes, 
                       directed = FALSE)

# Show the network object
health_dep_net
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
